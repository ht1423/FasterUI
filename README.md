# My React Project

Hey! 👋👋 This is a simple React app I made. It’s all about showing cool stuff with nice design and smooth UI.

---

## What’s this? 🙄

Basically, it’s a website built with React and Tailwind CSS. I focused on making it look clean and responsive, with some neat background images and components.

---

## How to run it 

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ht1423/FasterUI.git
cd FasterUI
npm install
npm run dev

```
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and check it out!

Ready to go! 🚀

##Project structure 📑

├── assets/        # Images and icons

⚠️ Note about API Endpoint
The live API endpoint (https://phplaravel-1494371-5751203.cloudwaysapps.com/save-customer) blocks requests due to CORS policy.

To test locally, I’m using a proxy server via Vite to bypass CORS issues.

For production, this means the form currently does not directly hit the live API and needs proper backend/proxy setup to work.
